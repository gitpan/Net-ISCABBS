Revision history for Perl extension Net::ISCABBS.

0.3   Tue Sep 27 15:55:00 2004
        - Use the Forum Moderator information, as well as the "todo" count of
          unread messages, new as of today.

0.2   Mon Sep 27 15:55:00 2004
        - Based on Tanj's advice, only check the first digit of status codes,
          as well as reworking the code to accept key:value pairs in any 
          order.
        - Change the lastmessage/firstmessage hash keys to lastnote/firstnote,
          since that is how the system returns them and it's easier to 
          program that way.
