        - Changed the croak calls in the modules to "return 0" in order to let
          the client code handle failures in their own way.

        - Fixed bug that was causing incorrect date parsing in some forums.

0.2   Mon Sep 27 15:55:00 2004
        - Based on Tanj's advice, only check the first digit of status codes,
          as well as reworking the code to accept key:value pairs in any 
          order.
        - Change the lastmessage/firstmessage hash keys to lastnote/firstnote,
          since that is how the system returns them and it's easier to 
          program that way.
